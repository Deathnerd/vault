The maximum size of an object written to a storage backend is determined
by that backend.

For the integrated storage backend, the default limit (introduced in
Vault 1.5.0) is 1 MiB. This may be configured via `max_entry_size` in
the [storage stanza](/vault/docs/configuration/storage/raft#max_entry_size).
When storage entries larger than 512 KiB but lower than `max_entry_size` are
written, Vault will chunk these entries into smaller pieces when writing the
entry to Raft.

For the Consul storage backend, the default limit imposed by Consul is
512 KiB. This may be configured via Consulâ€™s
[`kv_max_value_size`](/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#kv_max_value_size)
parameter, introduced in version 1.5.3. However, Consul's internal storage
implementation will not chunk the storage entry into smaller pieces, and will
instead write the entry as a single, large write. Using large writes can
negatively affect performance, as even a small change may become a large
read-modify-write cycle on the entire entry. Larger writes may also destabilize
the Consul cluster by delaying heartbeats, leading to leadership instability.
